## WDN overview
![Local Image](./case-study-map.png)


This WDN contains 11 consumption units (yellow dots) and 7 joint nodes (black dots). Leakage can be simulated in the red nodes. We did not enable two or more leakage points at once in our research. Leakage is pressure-dependant, using the emitter coefficient feature on EPANET. 

The CSV file is structured as follows:
* Column 1: time (in seconds)
* Columns 2-20: flow on monitored nodes (N2-N20)
* Columns 21-39: pressure on monitored nodes (N2-N20)
* Columns 40-58: volume on monitored nodes (N2-N20)
* Columns 59-77: x coordinates of monitored nodes (N2-N20)
* Columns 78-96: y coordinates of monitored nodes (N2-N20)
* Columns 97-115: z coordinates of monitored nodes (N2-N20)
* Columns 116-133: indicate absence (0) or presence (1) of leakage on nodes N21-N38
* Columns 134-136: x-y-z coordinates of the active leakage (if there are none, they are filled with zeros)
* Column 137: weekday (reserve/future use)
